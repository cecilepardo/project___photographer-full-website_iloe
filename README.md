# project___photographer-full-website

This project is the rebuild of my personal photography website, designed as a fullstack application.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to create a photography website with:
- galleries of images stored in a MySQL database
- an administration system to manage galleries
- an online shop for prints or digital downloads (planned via Stripe)
- user authentication for secure access to admin features
- a maintainable and scalable architecture for future development

This project is ongoing and will continue to evolve over the coming weeks.

## What I practiced / will practice

- Designing and structuring a MySQL database for galleries and shop items
- Planning a fullstack architecture (frontend + backend)
- Building a React frontend and Express backend
- Implementing authentication and user roles
- Integrating payment systems (Stripe)
- Preparing for an admin interface to manage galleries
- Organizing project folders for scalability
- Maintaining a clean and modular codebase

## Status

This project is in progress.  
Current progress includes:
- Database setup in MySQL (designed with Workbench)
- Basic project scaffolding for frontend and backend

Future development will include:
- Admin system to add/manage galleries
- Shop with Stripe integration
- Full authentication system
- UI improvements and gallery features

## Notes

- This repository serves as both a portfolio project and a learning journey for advanced fullstack development.  
- The project is expected to be updated progressively as new features are implemented.
- Screenshots or live demos will be added as the project evolves.
